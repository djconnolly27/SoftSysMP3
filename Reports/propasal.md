# MP3 Player
##### Alex Bahner and Daniel Connolly 
#### Goal:
We plan to make an MP3 player using an Arduino, along the lines of this project: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UodfePdNfg8. The linked project uses an SD card reader, arduino, and simple circuit elements to create an MP3 player that can read MP3 files and play them over a speaker via an Arduino. We intend to begin our project by building a module similar to this before extending further. Our initial extension will include an LCD screen capable of displaying the song currently playing, and potentially other songs in the current playlist. We view this project as easily extensible in the realms of display capabilities and/or digital signal processing. A stretch goal for this project would be to make a hardware system on a breadboard that does all the same features of a basic MP3 player. Depending on our progress at the beginning of the project and how long it takes to acquire parts, we may use the SD card readers built into our computer and learn how to process, modify, and output audio files to an Arduino or audio.

#### Learning Goals
Our learning goals include gaining a deeper understanding of the C language and its interaction with the Arduino specifically. We hope to gain some embedded systems and signal processing experience in the process as well.

We are currently looking into different parts and have reviewed a variety of similar open-source projects online. The project seem to be easy scalable.

#### Parts to buy
VS1053
MAX98306
Speaker
Headphone Jack

#### First Steps
Our first steps are

1. Ordering parts: we will define this as complete after we have sent an order into the ECE stockroom

2. Investigating Arduino / C libraries to use: This task will be complete after we have started development of our system using decided-upon libraries

3. Getting our system to play an audio file: This task is fairly self-explanatory. It is complete when we can play an audio file over a speaker via arduino.
